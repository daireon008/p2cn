# Messaging Functionality - 
1. Run messaging_server.py first by typing `python3 messaging_server.py` in the command prompt.
2. Run messaging_client.py next by typing `python3 messaging_client.py` in the command prompt.
3. Connection should now be established and the client can start the conversation.

Note: At most 2 connections can be maintained in this network.

# P2P File-Sharing Functionality using a Centralized Directory Server - 
1. First check `clients.py` and see if the ifconfig command is valid for your PC (if not valid the code would have to be changed).
2. Run the centralized directory server first by typing `python3 centralized_directory_server`
